# Visual Music Sequencer – Play with Rhythm & Code

This is a fun and experimental project where I build **visual music sequencers** from scratch using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

Each version is a standalone file with a slightly different look, feel, or sound logic. Some are basic click-to-play setups, while others start to shape into animated beat machines. It’s all about combining code with creativity.

### 🎧 What’s a Visual Music Sequencer?

A visual music sequencer lets you **interact with beats and rhythms** by clicking boxes, toggling inputs, or triggering animations. Think: light-up grids, color-based note pads, or visual loops that produce sound patterns.

Each version explores something new — better timing, smoother animations, layout tweaks, or more musical structure.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML** – for structure  
- **CSS** – for visual layout, animation  
- **JavaScript** – to handle audio playback, step sequencing, and interactions  
- No libraries used — all raw, self-built logic

### 🎯 Why I Built This

- To get better with DOM manipulation and timed animations  
- To practice audio handling in the browser  
- Because combining code and music is just really fun

This project is still growing — and I plan to keep experimenting.
